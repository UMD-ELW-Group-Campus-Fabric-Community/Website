This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Data Source
This repository uses data thats structure mirrors the data presented from the database. In order to query data directly from the database, clone the [database-1 repository](https://github.com/UMD-ELW-Group-Campus-Fabric-Community/Database-1) and run the docker-container. Refer to repository `README.md` for further instructions for setting up the database.
**Note that you do not need the database to develop the website**

## Getting Started
First, install the dependencies:
Note: This project was created using yarn, you may want to consider installing yarn first.
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn | yarn install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/*](http://localhost:3000/api/*). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/*.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
